# Jellyfin Scripts

A collection of scripts that make my life easier when managing a considerably large Jellyfin library.


## Scripts

**[merge-multi-versions.py](scripts/merge-multi-versions.py)**

*Imagine you have many episoded of a tv show, but the subtitles are not embedded and instead of one video file with multiple audio tracks, there are multiple video files with one audio track each.*

This script will combine the video with all audio and subtitle languages present into a single file.


## Tools

**[MediaBar listgen](tools/mediabar-listgen/README.md)**

A Python script to generate a simple list of item IDs based on variety conditions and filters. The resulting list.txt file can be used by the [Jellyfin MediaBar Plugin](https://github.com/MakD/Jellyfin-Media-Bar).
