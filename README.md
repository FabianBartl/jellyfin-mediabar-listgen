# Jellyfin Media-Bar listgen

A Python script to generate a simple list of item IDs based on a defined set of conditions. The resulting list.txt file can be used by the [Jellyfin Media-Bar Plugin](https://github.com/MakD/Jellyfin-Media-Bar).

This tool is in active development. The outline of the format used to define the conditions is there, but the exact names of filters etc. can change at any time at the moment.

You can find a detailed example configuration here: [mediabar.yaml](mediabar.yaml)
