# Jellyfin MediaBar listgen

A Python script to generate a simple list of item IDs based on a variety of conditions and filters. The resulting list.txt file can be used by the [Jellyfin MediaBar Plugin](https://github.com/MakD/Jellyfin-Media-Bar).

This tool is in active development. The outline of the format used to define the conditions is there, but the exact names of filters etc. can change at any time at the moment.

You can find an example configuration here: [example.yaml](example.yaml)
